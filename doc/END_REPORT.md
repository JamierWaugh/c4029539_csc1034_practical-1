A reflection on my first project at Newcastle University
===

I will be discussing how I found using the tools in this project.

Hardware
---
In terms of hardware, I used my personal device to complete this project, this didn't require much adaptation as I already had it setup but I enjoyed being able to take my work anywhere such as at home. In future - if permitted - I plan on completing most of my course work on my own device although I have linked my school email to my personal Github account so all of my repositories should be viewable.

Software
---
For version control, I had to learn how to push to a git repository, I did this using git bash. This took awhile to get the hang of but I feel confident in creating and updating git repositories now using this software. Furthermore, I enjoyed the more professional formating with all the documentation and requirements I had to read through and produce as it gave me a glimpse into what a future career may look like.

Markdown, I have never used markdown before and have found it difficult to learn but I believe I am starting to understand it. I have learnt its use by creating a more legible reading experience for repositories than just using text files compared to file formats such as word as it contains version history.

For the programming:

I was already confident in my python knowledge before this project. However, after not programming for a few months it acted as a solid refresher to get my brain back in gear. I'm pleased with the inclusion of key concepts such as: classes, functions, procedures as I was out of practice with these. I also found it made good practice of new concepts such as command line operations as seen with --no-rotate and other implementations. This required new libraries such as argparse and panda3d which I will touch on later.

Having never used panda3d, this project served as a solid introduction to the library - which I now view it as a great option as a 3D engine having only previously used pygame to render graphics; I may use panda3d in the future to achieve 3D game development or rendered environments such as this panda enclosure. I enjoyed how simple the loading of background music(mp3 files) and rendering of models such as the panda and the background was.

I was also new to the argparse library, this library allowed my project to include command line operations as seen in the README file. I was new to this concept and this project was a great introduction, I had previously not known you could impact software through the command line and I will definitely try incorporate this into any future projects I complete. It also allowed for much easier debugging as I could ensure the main program worked and then worry about the other command line operations separately - narrowing down where any potential errors could occur.
